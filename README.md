# YouTube-8k-4k-video-downloader-
This is a simple python based, youtube video downloader. Unlike traditional video downloaders On-line, this uses "ffmpeg" locally to download and combine high-bitrate, UHD youtube videos without compressing them.
The main source file is in, "main.py". The accompanying ".gif" files need to be kept in the same folder as the python script to ensure that the GUI works as intended.
IMPORTANT!!! ffmpeg needs to be downloaded and located universally for the script to work. If not,  it will fail to import required libraries.
Download ffmpeg from https://www.ffmpeg.org.
